# Libft

### ğŸ“š My very first own library
This project aims to recreate some standard C library functions and introduce additional ones that can be utilized to build a library of useful functions for the program.

## Technologies Used
![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/_-C-555555.svg?style=for-the-badge)
![MAKEFILE](https://img.shields.io/badge/_-MAKEFILE-427819.svg?style=for-the-badge)

## Subject
### Mandatory
Recreating select functions from the libc library.

### Bonus
Creating functions for utilizing linked lists.

## Getting Started
```shell
git clone https://github.com/niamu01/libft
cd libft
make [all, re, clean, fclean, bonus]
```
- `make all`: Compiles mandatory files and creates the libft.a file.
- `make re`: Performs an incremental build.
- `make clean`: Removes object files.
- `make fclean`: Removes object files and the library file.
- `make bonus`: Builds, including bonus functions in the library.

This project compiles various functions into a single library file and prevent relinking.

## How To Use
You can use the libft.a file generated by make in another project

### Example:
```shell
gcc -o my_program my_source.c -L/path/to/libft -lft
```
> ğŸ’¡ Ensure the `/path/to/libft` is replaced with the actual path to your `libft.a` file.
